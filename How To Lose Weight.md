Popular Diet and Exercise Fads
========================================================
Many, many people have chased diet and exercise fads, hoping to quickly earn a "beach body."

Diet | Exercise
---- | --------
Cabbage Soup Diet | BowFlex Home Gym
South Beach Diet | P90X/Power90
The 3 Day Diet | Thighmaster
Hollywood Diet Plan | 8-minute Abs
Paleolithic Diet | Couch To 5K
Dr. Atkins' New Diet | Wii Fit
Eat More, Weigh Less | Pilates

And most of the people who've tried these diet and fitness programs have failed to maintain their new, healthy bodies.


Simple Truth about Your Weight
========================================================
I was sitting in my doctor's office waiting room one day and noticed a small book entitled "How To Lose Weight", authored by my doctor. Impressed, I opened the cover to flip through it. To my surprise, the book was blank except for the first page. The page simply read,

> *"Burn more calories than you consume, and do it for life."*

At the time, I thought it was silly. But as I've chased some of the diet and exercise mirages, I've learned that my doctor was right. And it really is that simple. All of the diet and exercise fads could have worked if I'd understood this.


Do You Need to Lose Weight?
========================================================
<small>We need to determine where you are, so that you can set a goal for where you need to be and to be able to monitor your progress toward your goal.<br>
<br>
A common and simple measure of overall health is BMI (Body Mass Index). One way to calculate BMI is by height (in inches) and weight (in pounds). For example, here is the BMI for a 6-foot tall 200-lb person:</small>

```r
height <- 72; weight <- 200
BMI <- 703 * (weight / height^2)
BMI
```

```
[1] 27.12
```
<small>A BMI between 25 and 29.9 suggests you are overweight for your height.</small>

Calories Burned vs. Calories Consumed
========================================================
Your daily calorie burn is composed of two things:
- **RMR**: Resting metabolic rate is an estimate of how many calories are required to keep your body functioning.
- **Activity**: Your physical activity level (including exercise).

Your daily calorie consumption includes everything you eat or drink. (Hint: drink more water!)

If you consume more than you burn, you will gain weight.<br>
But if you burn more than you consume, you will lose weight.<br>
**It is as simple as that.**
